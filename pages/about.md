Hi, I'm "Air1" !

I'm a 28 years old french developer, who entered the crypto world in 2017. I started to learn and I understood how big a revolution
it was.

After some months I decided I needed to get more involved and find a good project to learn and contribute. I chose Ark for
its potential, technology and being so open to external contributors.

Now after having some experience I am more motivated to keep going on with Ark. I am sharing here the things I learn
along my Ark journey ðŸ˜€
